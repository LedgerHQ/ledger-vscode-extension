[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that provides a quick and easy way to build and test
applications for [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) devices.

The extension uses Ledger's own [Docker image](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder/blob/master/dev-tools/Dockerfile)
to allow developers to setup a build and test environment in a few minutes.

* Build your app for all Ledger devices.
* Supports C and Rust apps.
* Stay up to date with the latest SDK.
* Run [tests](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/device-app/integration/requirements/development#tests)
  on the device emulator ([Speculos](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos)) or on a real device.
* Supports multiple apps folders in the same workspace, each folder having its own Docker container.
* See what's executed by the extension in VS Code's terminal panels.
* Run [development guidelines](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/device-app/integration/requirements/development#workflows)
  checks to ensure your app is ready to get deployed

## Features

### Tasks

Automatically add tasks to help you build, test and load your app on a physical device.
These tasks are accessible through the build task menu keyboard shortcut to avoid clicking around.

  (see [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) for mac and [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/project) for windows).
  Otherwise, some testing tasks will not work. **Make sure client connections are allowed**.
